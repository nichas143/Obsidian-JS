If we write the function as 
```js
function funcName () { 
	// this is the function body
}
funcName();
```

the above function definition is called function declaration. 


- Function declaration creates an identifier in the enclosing scope (if the function is in the global scope then the function is in global scope)

from the above program we can see that *function identifier* is defined in the global scope (or enclosing scope of the function)

but cannot be said about *function expression*
